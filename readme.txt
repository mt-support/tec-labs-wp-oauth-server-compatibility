== Description ==

This extension allows The Events Calendar views to successfully navigate when WP OAuth Server is set to block all unauthenticated REST requests.

The plugin works by identifying REST requests for The Events Calendar navigation and contextually filtering the WP OAuth Server settings such that the TEC REST endpoint authentication is not overridden.

For backwards compatibility, if this section is missing, the full length of the short description will be used, and Markdown parsed.
